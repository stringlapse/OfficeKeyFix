# OfficeKeyFix

Unbinds the Office Key (Shift+Control+Alt+Win) related shortcuts, allowing you to use Office+W in other applications.

Full list of unbound shortcuts and their original behavior (`Office` means `Shift+Control+Alt+Win`):
- `Office`: Opens Office UWP app
- `Office+D`: Opens OneDrive
- `Office+L`: Opens LinkedIn by opening `https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2044786` (which redirects to `https://www.linkedin.com/?trk=Officekey`) in the default browser
- `Office+N`: Opens OneNote for Windows 10 UWP app
- `Office+O`: Opens Outlook
- `Office+P`: Opens PowerPoint
- `Office+T`: Opens Teams by opening `https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2044782` (which reditects to `https://teams.microsoft.com/`) in the default browser
- `Office+W`: Opens Word
- `Office+X`: Opens Excel
- `Office+Y`: Opens the marketing page for Yammer by opening `https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2044904` (which reditects to `https://www.yammer.com/`) in the default browser
- `Office+Space`: Opens the emoji picker

You'll need to compile the script into a binary, and place it in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` so it will run on startup. There is a good guide for this here: https://github.com/anthonyheddings/OfficeKeyFix/issues/1#issuecomment-610310521
